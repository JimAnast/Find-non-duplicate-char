# Find-non-duplicate-char

Consider a list of characters which are sorted in an increasing order. Each character is duplicated except one which corresponds to the non-duplicate character in the list.

Example 1:

Input list: ['a','a','b','b','c','d','d','e','e','r','r']

Non-duplicate: c 

Example 2:

Input list: ['a','c','c','d','d','f','f','z','z']

Non-duplicate: a 

This program finds the non-duplicate character based on the divide and conquer approach. It takes a sorted list of characters as an input and returns the non-duplicate character.
